Based in web browser technologies, the 3D scene uses the motion sensors of your mobile phone to allow a natural visual exploration. \n\nThe Catherine Storr Experience contributes to ongoing work in Digital Cultures at Newcastle University’s Culture Lab into the fusion of cultural heritage with new forms of creativity through the use of digital technologies. We hope that this experimental work encourages new experiences of Catherine Storr’s books and the Catherine Storr archive at Seven Stories. \n\nAfter enjoying the interactive Virtual Reality guided tour, you may want to learn more about Catherine Storr, her work, and the material held by Seven Stories. There is a link that will lead you to more detailed information at the end of the tour or alternatively go straight to it by clicking

US.\n\nYou can track the season in a regular browser, or on a mobile device supporting gyroscope feedback. For a complete immersive experience Virtual Forest supports Google Cardboard and Samsung GearVR. Additional support for VR headsets such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift is provided through the A-frame framework.\n\nThe project gives everyone the experience of tracking the seasons in a North Eastern deciduous forest through tele-presence. It allows for leaf peeping from a distance and visualizes, otherwise slow, ecological processes using timelapse movies. The images gathered will also support research efforts in understanding the timing of changes to the canopy structure. Above all, I hope Virtual Forest will inspire people to venture outdoors and explore a forest in real life as Virtual Forest remains a proxy for what is a wonderful world.","picks":"","positional":"no","reddit_urls":"","release_date":"","requirement_for_chromium_desktop":"no","requirement_for_firefox_desktop":"no","requirement_for_gamepad":"no","requirement_for_htc_vive":"no","requirement_for_oculus_rift":"no","requirement_for_samsung_gear_vr":"no","roomscale":"","screenshots":"https://dl.airtable.com/wH6v6FKDTA6cV7KPdm5K_CvFmtu1VMAA_MmA.jpg%3Alarge","seated":"","source_code_url":"","standing":"","support_for_chromium_desktop":"yes","support_for_firefox_desktop":"yes","support_for_gamepad":"","support_for_htc_vive":"yes","support_for_oculus_rift":"yes","support_for_samsung_gear_vr":"yes","tags":"photosphere,ambient,nature","tweet_urls":"https://twitter.com/motherboard/status/787655518068219905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw","url":"http://virtualforest.io/","uses_frameworks":"A-Frame","video_urls":"","videos":"","web_app_manifest_json":"","webvr_api_version_support":"","works_with_devices":"Samsung
